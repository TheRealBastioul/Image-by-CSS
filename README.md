# Image-by-CSS

## About

This repository contains the code to create a stylized representation of a Mario head using only HTML and CSS. It demonstrates the power of CSS in creating detailed images without the need for traditional image files.

## How to Use

To see this Mario head in action and make your own modifications, follow these steps:

1. Go to the repository's main page: [Image-by-CSS](https://github.com/TheRealBastioul/Image-by-CSS).
2. Open the `mario.htm` file and copy the HTML and CSS code.
3. Visit [jsfiddle.net](https://jsfiddle.net/).
4. Paste the HTML code into the HTML section and the CSS code into the CSS section on jsfiddle.
5. Click "Run" to see the Mario head rendered on the screen.

You can tweak the CSS on jsfiddle to change colors, shapes, and more to see how your changes affect the final image.
